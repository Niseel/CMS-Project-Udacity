### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.
- *My choice is App service*
- *Personally, I think the CMS app is quite simple, with the main task of saving records about the information of an article.* 
- *The right infrastructure for a CMS app is PaaS. It has all the dependencies supported, is quite easy to manage, and does not take too much time to configure from scratch like VMs (IaaS), so it can easily integrate with Azure Active Directory.*

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*For example, in a scenario where a CMS app needs to do more to deal with issues related to latency, security, and cross-platform connectivity, I will need a different approach that can easily penetrate deeper to configure these issues. At that time, I will really consider switching the app service to VMs*
